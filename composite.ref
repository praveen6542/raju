Suggested places: Kanchi Mutt another than TTD lodges are the Kashi Mutt, Ahobila Mutt among several others (all are close to each other on a ring road, and can be approached by foot from the temple). Be warned though that priority is given to people associated with the mutt's community and you will neither get room service nor air conditioned rooms - but the rooms are well maintained, clean and come with clean beds and sheets. For the Mutt maintained lodges, prior registration is strongly advised. However, do not have high expectations on cleanliness when staying in these mutts. Some of the examples by various travellers that cleanliness of these mutts aren't guaranteed.

Beach view at Tenneti Park in Visakhapatnam

Respect[edit]

==========
Kailash Hill (Kailasagiri). 6 km away from the city centre. There is a park atop the hill, with a beautiful view of the city, the sea and Eastern Ghats merging into the sea. One can take a ropeway directly facing sea and city. On the hill top there is a beautiful toy train offering a tour of nature. Several view points give a pleasant look of the nature. This is less commercial than other hill stations and there is less hassle by tourist guides. After descending from Kailashgiri one should visit Tenneti Beach Park. Its beauty and luxuriant carpet grass intertwined with concrete pathways makes it ideal for romantic couples. There are several points from which the beautiful rocky beach down beneath can be seen. This provides spectacular views of sunrise, sunset and the pristine waters. Many movies were shot here. Hillocks in the park which is about 50 ft in elevation give a beautiful view of the sea, beach road and the beach park. The ambiance at this Tenneti Beach park is simply mind blowing.If you have a couple of days to spare, don't miss the train journey from Visakhapatnam to Araku, which is the most enjoyable train route in the state. There is only one train to Araku from Vizag which starts at 6:50AM at Vizag railway station. It is a four-hour journey in the Eastern Ghats which covers many tunnels and valleys on the way. "Shimiliguda" railway station, on the route, is the highest railway station in India on broad-gauge track.

18.333382.86671 Araku Valley. Six hours by train or public bus, this is a scenic valley. A slow, passenger train leaves the Vizag station early in the morning (at 6:50AM), and the train ride is enjoyable. Arrive at least an hour before its departure to get a seat. The train runs through small mountains and tunnels. Araku Valley is definitely not a day trip, but the APTDC facilities can serve as a decent lodging. Book your APTDC rooms early. Padmavathi botanical gardens is worth visiting. November to February are the best months to visit and making an early reservation in the lodges is advisable as Araku Valley has few lodges and hotels. Travel in and Araku valley is limited by limited public bus service. At APTDC lodge, cabs can be hired for a day trip through the valley to Bora caves; the ride is amazing.

17.7492283.34223 Kailasagiri. The ride to this hill offers a spectacular view of the sea, RK. Beach and Rushikonda Beach on right and left hand side. There is a huge sculpture of Shiva and Parvathi. With a children's play area, a people-mover akin to a ski lift called a ropeway. Beautiful scenic view can be obtained from the ropeway, especially in the evening, when the city is lit up. The up and down fare for the ropeway is ₹44 (Dec 2006). A doll museum and a couple of eating areas, this hilltop gives a nice bird's eye view of the city also. Has several "viewpoints" affording wonderful views of the city on one side and winding beaches adjoining green hills on the other side. It is a likeable beach city, especially after visiting Kailasagiri. Based on this beautiful and rare combination of hill and beach. Tenneti park is a spectacular Eco marvel at the foot of the Rope way.

17.710183.015026 Bojjana Konda. It is near Sankaram village in the hamlet of Anakapalli, 40 km from Visakhapatnam, and offers architectural remnants of the Buddhist period, one of the earliest of its class in South India. It constitutes one of the most remarkable groups of Buddhist monuments dated from 200 BC to 700 AD, found during excavations in 1906. On the eastern hill, there are a series of rock-cut caves, numerous groups of monolithic dagobas, standing on rock platform in tiers above each other and, crowning all, a rock-cut stupa with extensive structural remains. On the western side of the eastern hill is a stairway, partly rock-cut and partly structural, which leads up to a large double-storied cave. The cave is entered by a doorway and is flanked on each side by huge dwarapalas. The cave chamber is rectangular in shape and is divided into 20 compartments by four cross rocks of 16 massive pillars. In the centre is the rock-cut stupa standing on a square platform.

Buddhist excavations. Bojjana Konda, Thotla Konda, Bhavi Konda and Salihundam around Visakhapatnam were centres of Buddhism during the second century A.D. Several Buddhist monuments such as stupas and chaityas were erected at these places. It is said that some of the corporal relics of the Buddha were preserved at these places. Hence all these places became sacred places.

More than anything else, Vizag is known for its beaches. It boasts a number of beaches that are scenic and uncrowded. A few virgin beaches span along the eastern side of the city and stretch for miles. Do not go swimming. A spectacular beach only the locals are aware of is called the "Yarada" beach. Except for the occasional RTC bus, there is no public transport available. Still, the adventurous mind finds it rewarding if they can make an effort to get there. It's a private beach coming under Agrigold plantations therefor you need to pay a fee of ₹30/- to get onto the beach, but it's worth it.

17.7141683.323669 Ramakrishna Beach. R.K.Beach is the most popular beach in the sense that, you can find the locals hanging out during the hot summers, and relatively less hot winters. On weekends and holidays, one can see that the entire beach comes alive, but not in a western sense where people take a plunge in the water, or surf. You can see people dressed in their best clothes, just sitting on the benches, or walking along. Caution: a lot of people have died while swimming. Take an evening stroll at RK Beach; it offers good pedestrian tracks, beautiful parks, museums, beaches and some wonderful open air restaurants.

17.6541383.267111 Yarada Beach. It is perceived as a private beach but actually it is not. Tourists can visit the beach directly or through the Yarada village. Agrigold collects a fee of ₹30 to enter their property and access the Shops and a Restaurant. If you could bring your own food/refreshments, you could visit the beach without entering the Agrigold Property. Yarada is the village behind the dolphin nose. To go to this beach, bus facility is available. Also you can hire a cab to go there. The view of the beach and Vizag city from the top of the dolphin nose is memorable. Also the Gangavaram Beach is nearer from Yarada Beach. The drive from Scindia to the top of dolphin nose, dolphin nose to Yarada and from there to Gangavaram is really enjoyable.
